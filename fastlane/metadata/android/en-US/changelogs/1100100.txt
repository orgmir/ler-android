New features:
- Add new posts notification! You will now get notified when there are new posts for you to read. This can be toggled per subscription as well.
- New settings screen! This is where you can configure the new posts notification time or disable it entirely. You can also disable the subscriptions background refresh from here.
Bug fixes:
- Fixed update URL for a subscription not getting parsed correctly.
- Fixed post published date parsing, now uses the device locale (and it actually works).
- Reduce the subscription refresh rate from every 15 minutes to every 12 hours.
- Update app to use latest versions of libraries
